</details>

### Verify Browser Installation:

The Playwright MCP Server may need to install browsers on first use. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in Agent mode and ask:

```
Using the Playwright MCP Server, check if browsers are installed. If not, install them.
```

This will ensure Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers are available for testing.

## 🚀 Step 2: Start Your Blazor Application

Before we can take screenshots, we need to have the application running.

### Instructions:

1. Open a new terminal in VS Code
2. Navigate to the eCommApp-NET directory:
   ```powershell
   cd eCommApp-NET
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```powershell
   dotnet watch
   ```
4. Wait for the application to start and note the URL (typically `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`)
5. Keep this terminal running in the background

## 📸 Step 3: Capture Your First Screenshot

Now let's use GitHub Copilot with the Playwright MCP Server to capture screenshots of your running application.

### Instructions:

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat and switch to **Agent** mode
2. Use the following prompt to capture a screenshot of the home page:

```
Using the Playwright MCP Server, navigate to http://localhost:5000 and take a full-page screenshot of the home page. Save it as "homepage.png" in a "screenshots" folder.
```

3. **Click "Allow"** when GitHub Copilot asks for permission to use the Playwright tools
4. Watch as GitHub Copilot:
   - Opens a browser
   - Navigates to your application
   - Takes a screenshot
   - Saves it to the specified location

5. Once complete, check the `screenshots` folder in your workspace to see the captured image!

### 💡 What's Happening Behind the Scenes:

When you use the Playwright MCP Server through GitHub Copilot Agent:
1. Agent interprets your natural language request
2. Calls the appropriate Playwright MCP tools (like `browser_snapshot` or `browser_take_screenshot`)
3. Playwright launches a real browser instance
4. Executes the navigation and screenshot commands
5. Saves the image file to your workspace

## 🧪 Step 4: Automate Multiple Screenshots

Let's capture screenshots of all the key pages in your application in one go.

### Instructions:

Use this comprehensive prompt in Agent mode:

```
Using the Playwright MCP Server, help me document the Daily Harvest Blazor application by taking screenshots of the following pages. Navigate to http://localhost:5000 and:

1. Take a screenshot of the home page and save it as "screenshots/01-home-page.png"
2. Navigate to the products page (/products) and take a screenshot, save as "screenshots/02-products-page.png"
3. Click on the first product to view details and take a screenshot, save as "screenshots/03-product-details.png"
4. Navigate to the cart page (/cart) and take a screenshot, save as "screenshots/04-cart-page.png"

Wait a moment between each navigation to ensure the page loads completely. Use full-page screenshots for all captures.
```

### 📊 Observe the Process:

Watch GitHub Copilot Agent as it:
- ✅ Plans the sequence of actions
- 🌐 Opens the browser once and reuses it
- 🔄 Navigates through each page systematically
- 📸 Takes each screenshot with proper naming
- 💾 Saves all images to the screenshots folder
- 📝 Reports completion status

## 🎯 Step 5: Interactive Testing with Screenshots

Now let's use Playwright to interact with the UI and capture states during user flows.

### Instructions:

Try this advanced prompt that simulates a user journey:

```
Using the Playwright MCP Server, simulate a user shopping journey in the Blazor app at http://localhost:5000:

1. Start at the home page and take a screenshot (screenshots/journey-01-start.png)
2. Click on the "Products" navigation link
3. Take a screenshot of the products page (screenshots/journey-02-products.png)
4. Click the "Add to Cart" button on the first product
5. Take a screenshot showing the cart with the item (screenshots/journey-03-cart-with-item.png)
6. Navigate to the cart page
7. Take a final screenshot of the cart page (screenshots/journey-04-cart-page.png)

Between each action, wait 1 second for the page to update. Capture full-page screenshots.
```

### 💭 Reflection:

After running this automation, consider:
- How long would this take to do manually?
- How easy would it be to repeat this for every code change?
- Could you use this for regression testing?

## 🔍 Step 6: Accessibility Snapshot and Analysis

Playwright can also capture accessibility information from your pages. Let's use this to analyze your Blazor application's accessibility.

### Instructions:

```
Using the Playwright MCP Server, analyze the accessibility of the Daily Harvest Blazor application:

1. Navigate to https://localhost:5001
2. Take an accessibility snapshot of the home page
3. Analyze the snapshot and tell me:
   - Are there any images without alt text?
   - Are headings used in proper hierarchical order?
   - Are interactive elements properly labeled?
   - Any accessibility concerns to address?

Then take a regular screenshot for reference and save it as "screenshots/accessibility-homepage.png"
```

### 🎓 Understanding Accessibility Snapshots:

Unlike regular screenshots, accessibility snapshots provide:
- Semantic structure of the page
- ARIA attributes and roles
- Heading hierarchy
- Form labels and associations
- Focus order information

This is invaluable for ensuring your Blazor application is accessible to all users!

## 🎁 Optional Task: Create a Visual Test Suite

Now that you understand how to use Playwright through GitHub Copilot, create a comprehensive visual test suite.

### Challenge:

Ask GitHub Copilot Agent to:

```
Using the Playwright MCP Server, create a comprehensive visual documentation suite for the Daily Harvest Blazor app. For each major page (Home, Products, Product Details, Cart, Login, Admin), take:

1. A full-page screenshot in desktop view (1920x1080)
2. A mobile viewport screenshot (375x667)
3. An accessibility snapshot analysis

Save all screenshots in organized folders: screenshots/desktop/ and screenshots/mobile/

After capturing all screenshots, create a markdown report (screenshots/README.md) that:
- Lists all captured screenshots with descriptions
- Includes the accessibility analysis findings
- Suggests UI improvements based on what you observed
```

This creates a complete visual test suite that you can run before every release!

## 🤖 Step 7: Generate Playwright Test Code

Finally, let's have GitHub Copilot generate actual Playwright test code based on the interactions.

### Instructions:

```
Based on the screenshot automation we did earlier, generate a C# Playwright test file that:

1. Navigates through the main pages of the Blazor app
2. Takes screenshots at each step
3. Validates that key elements are visible (headers, buttons, products)
4. Can be run as part of our xUnit test suite

Save the test as "eCommApp-NET.Tests/E2E/PlaywrightVisualTests.cs"

Include:
- Proper async/await patterns
- Page object pattern for better maintainability
- Comments explaining each test step
- Screenshot capture on test failures
```

This will generate actual test code you can integrate into your CI/CD pipeline!

## 📊 Step 8: Review Your Visual Documentation

Let's review what you've created.

### Instructions:

1. Open the `screenshots` folder in VS Code Explorer
2. Review all the captured images
3. Notice how they document:
   - ✅ Current state of your UI
   - ✅ User interaction flows
   - ✅ Responsive design at different viewports
   - ✅ Visual evidence for bug reports or feature demos

4. Ask GitHub Copilot to analyze the screenshots:

```
Review the screenshots we captured in the screenshots/ folder and tell me:
- Are there any visual inconsistencies?
- Do the pages follow a consistent design pattern?
- Are there any UI elements that appear broken or misaligned?
- What improvements would you suggest for the user experience?
```
